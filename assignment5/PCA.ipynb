        "Welcome to the last ML assignment in which you will experiment (and hopefully get some experience) with a technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method is often used in Machine Learning for \"dimensionality reduction\", that is for reducing the dimensionality of the data. Put in other words, it is used to \"compress\" the data without (hopefully) lossing too much information. PCA can also be used for compressing images, during exploratory data analysis (when we try to \"get a sense of the data\") or as a visualization technique (when we try to \"see what our data looks like\"). \n",
        "\n",
        "We can also view PCA as an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns a representation of data. This learned representation is based on two criteria. First, PCA learns a representation that has lower dimensionality than the original data. Second, elements in this representation have no linear correlations with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA learns orhogonal linear transformation of the data. This transformation tries to learn the best projection that keeps as much information about the data as possible, meassured by least-squared reconstruction error. Let us start with some neccessary imports, as we usually do.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: Due to time constraints, this assignment will _\"scratch the surface\"_  when it comes to deriving the actual process of obtaining the principal components. If you would like a more in-depth guide, we strongly recommend [this tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20181020043046/https://tkv.io/posts/tutorial-on-pca/)."

These basis images (also known  as Eigenpictures) could be linearly combined to reconstruct images in the original training set.\n",
